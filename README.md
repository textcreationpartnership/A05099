benefit of God, it is daily created, & not by the vertue of nature. Cha. 90.

    _ Of the argument for the immortalitie of the ſoule, that may be taken from
that naturall deſire thereof, and of perpetuitie, which is in it: of another
argument to the ſame purpoſe: of the deſire which men haue to continue
their name and memory for euer: an argument to the ſame ende
taken from the apprehenſion and terror which men may haue both of the
death of the body, and alſo of the ſoule and ſpirit. Chap. 91.

    _ Of the argument that may be taken from the delights and pleaſures of the
ſoule to prooue the immortalitie thereof: an argument to the ſame ende
taken from the inſatiable deſires and pleaſures of men, euen from ſuch
as are most carnall: of the testimony which they may find euen in their
vices to prooue the immortalitie of their ſoule. Chap. 92.

    _ Of the testimonie that men haue of the immortal nature of the ſoule in their
very body, by the compoſition and frame thereof: of that which is in the
motion and reſt of their ſoule: how the creation of the whole world ſhould
be vaine, & how there ſhould be no prouidēce of God no religion no diuine
iuſtice if the ſoule were mortall: of the multitude and qualities of the witneſſes
that ſtand for the immortalitie thereof. Chap. 93.

    _ Of an other argument for the immortalitie of the ſoule taken from that naturall
desire which men haue of knowledge: of Aristoteles opinion touching
the nature and immortalitie of the ſoule: of other reaſons of Philoſophers
to prooue that the ſpirite can not be of a corruptible and mortall nature:
and how iuſt men ſhould be more miſerable, and ſhould haue more
occaſion to feare and to eſchew death, then the vniuſt and wicked, if the
ſoule were mortall. Chap. 94.

    _ Of that praiſe and reward which wiſedome and vertue may receiue of men
in this world: how miſerable it is, if there be no better prepared for them
els-where: how death would be more grieuous and lamentable to the best
learned and wiſeſt men, then to the ignorant and fooliſh, if the ſoule were
mortall: how the beſt and moſt certaine iudgement of men is for the immortalitie
of the ſoule: of them who not beleeuing the ſame, ſay that it
is good for men to be in ſuch an errour. Chap. 95.

    _ Of thoſe internall teſtimonies, which all men cary within themſelues, to conuince
them that doubt of the immortality of the ſoule, & of the iudgement
to come, which ſhalbe in eternall happines for the good, and perpetuall torment
for the euill: how the very Heathen acknowledged as much by reaſons
taken from the teſtimonies of nature. Chap. 96.

1. THE THIRTEENTH
dayes worke.

    _ Of the teſtimonies which euery one may take from his conſcience: of that feare
vnto which all men are naturally ſubiect to prooue the immortalitie of the
ſoule, and a iudgement of God vpon the iuſt and vniuſt: howe that which
the Atheiſts ſay, that feare cauſeth gods amongeſt men, ſerueth to ouerthrow
their damnable opinion. Chap. 97.

    _ Whether Epicures and Atheists be reaſonable beaſts yea or no, and what reaſons
they bring to ouerthrow the immortalitie of the ſoule: of the falſe opinion
of Pliny touching the ſame, and of his friuolous and brutiſh reaſons to
this purpoſe: of the brutiſh concluſion, vnbeſeeming the whole race of mankinde,
which he maketh of this matter, and of the iudgement of God vpon
him. Chap. 98.

    _ Of them who ſay, that we can not knowe by the light of nature but that
the ſoule is mortall: of them that alleadge a place of Salomon againſt
the immortalitie of the ſoule: how we ought to conſider of the iudgements
of God vpon Epicures and Atheiſts: howe the abſurdities,
which followe their doctrine, declare plainely the groſeneſſe of it: of
the force of thoſe arguments that were produced before for the immortalitie
of the ſoule. Chap. 99.

    _ Of the image of God in the ſoule of man, and of the image of the worlde in
mans body: of the coniunction that is betweene God, the Angels, and men:
of the ſundry degrees of Good that are therein: of thoſe leſſons and inſtructions,
which we ought to receiue from the wonderfull compoſition and coniunction
of the ſoule and body. Chap. 100.
